# Waze Project - Predicting User Churn with Python

This is an end-of-course project under Google Advance Data Analytics Certificate.

In this project, I will delve into Waze's user data, employing Python for exploration, analysis, and model development to predict user churn.

### Backgroud on Waze scenario:
Waze’s free navigation app makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want to go. Waze’s community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users helps make each drive better and safer. Waze partners with cities, transportation authorities, broadcasters, businesses, and first responders to help as many people as possible travel more efficiently and safely.

This project is part of an effort at Waze to increase growth. Typically, high retention rates indicate satisfied users who repeatedly use the Waze app over time. Developing a churn prediction model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business.

**The project entails:**

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Explore the provided dataset through comprehensive analysis using Python libraries.

### Regression Modeling
- Utilize Python to construct a binomial logistic regression model for predicting churn.

### Machine Learning Model Development
- Develop and evaluate various machine learning models using Python, aiming to accurately forecast user churn.
